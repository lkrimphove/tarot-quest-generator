        <h2>Help</h2>
        <section>
            <p>The generator uses tarot cards to answer five key questions, helping you craft a fully-fledged quest:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> What is the main goal or theme of the quest?</li>
                <li><strong>Quest Giver:</strong> Who initiates the quest or seeks the player's help?</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> What significant obstacle or challenge must the player overcome?</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Where does the quest take place?</li>
                <li><strong>Result Or Reward:</strong> What is the outcome or reward for completing the quest?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cards can have one of two orientations (upright or reversed - you can also turn this off). Each of them
                has a
                different meaning. In general reversed cards have a darker tone to them.</p>
            <p>You can reverse or reroll cards as many times as you want to - or you can generate a completely new
                quest. When you are happy with your cards you interpret them and adapt them to your game. Then all you
                have left to do is let your players suffer</p>
