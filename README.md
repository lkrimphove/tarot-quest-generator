# Tarot Quest Generator

**Tarot Quest Generator** is a tool designed to inspire and generate quests for tabletop role-playing games. Whether you're crafting adventures for a grim dark setting like [MÖRK BORG](https://morkborg.com) or any other world of your creation, this generator provides a wealth of prompts using tarot cards.

## Features

- **Versatile Quest Generation**: The generator can be used for any setting, but it is especially well-suited for grim dark fantasy worlds.
- **Tarot-Based Prompts**: Utilizes the symbolism of tarot cards to create quest prompts.
- **Endless Possibilities**: With 22 major arcana cards, each having an upright and reversed meaning, the generator can produce over a million unique combinations.

## How It Works

The generator uses tarot cards to answer five key questions, helping you craft a fully-fledged quest:

1. **Objective**: What is the main goal or theme of the quest?
2. **Quest Giver**: Who initiates the quest or seeks the player's help?
3. **Challenge**: What significant obstacle or challenge must the player overcome?
4. **Location**: Where does the quest take place?
5. **Result Or Reward**: What is the outcome or reward for completing the quest?

## Usage

Simply visit the [Tarot Quest Generator](https://ttrpg.krimphove.site) website, draw your tarot cards, and discover your next adventure. The tool is easy to use and provides you with prompts that can be adapted to any game system.

## Future Improvements

- Improve the card prompts (currently most of them are ai-generated placeholders and some are quite similiar to each other).
- Create a custom tarot card deck to better fit the grim dark nature of the generator.
- Refactor and polish code and improve the websites design where necessary.
- Translate content and add support for different languages.
- Build a Tarot Character Generator.
